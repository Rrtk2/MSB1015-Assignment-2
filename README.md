#### What is this project about
This repository is the final product of assignment 2, requested by the course MSB1015 (Scientific Programming). The goal is to create a repository which contains all information, documentation and files needed to run a wikidata query using html/javascript as a new user.
The setup of a [GitHub page](https://rrtk2.github.io/MSB1015-Assignment-2/) needs the following documents: _site.yml and index.Rmd. _site.yml contains the architecture of the github page. index.Rmd contains the actual R markdow script, which will be transferred into the website. When these files are set up, the rmarkdown::render_site() function is ran in the main (_site.yml) folder, this assembles the site and a _site folder will be created. The contents of the folder need to be transferred into the ~/docs/ folder of the repo. Github pages need to be enabled and set to the ~/docs/ folder of the repo.
